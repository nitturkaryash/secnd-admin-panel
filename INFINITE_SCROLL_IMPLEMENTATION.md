# Infinite Scroll Implementation for Appointment Calendar

## Overview
Implemented infinite scroll functionality for the appointment calendar that loads hourly appointment slots until 11:00 PM, with a user-friendly end-of-day message when the limit is reached.

## Changes Made

### 1. Extended Time Range
- **Before**: Calendar showed slots from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM (14 hours)
- **After**: Calendar shows slots from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM (15 hours)
- Updated `endHour` from 22 to 23 in time slot generation

### 2. Added End-of-Day Detection
- Added `hasReachedEnd` state to track when 11:00 PM is reached
- Added `maxSlots` constant (60 slots = 15 hours Ã— 4 slots per hour)
- Modified infinite scroll handler to check for maximum slots

### 3. Enhanced Scroll Logic
- Updated `handleScroll` callback to prevent loading beyond 11:00 PM
- Added condition to stop infinite scroll when `hasReachedEnd` is true
- Limited `generateExtendedTimeSlots` to not exceed hour 23

### 4. User Feedback
- Added end-of-day message that appears when user reaches 11:00 PM
- Message: "End of day reached. No more appointments after 11:00 PM."
- Styled with consistent design system colors and spacing

### 5. Code Cleanup
- Removed unused imports and variables
- Fixed TypeScript warnings
- Updated comments to reflect new time range

## Technical Details

### Key Components Modified
- `src/components/features/calendar/WeekCalendar.tsx`

### State Management
```typescript
const [hasReachedEnd, setHasReachedEnd] = useState(false);
const maxSlots = 60; // 15 hours * 4 slots per hour
```

### Scroll Handler Logic
```typescript
const handleScroll = useCallback(() => {
  if (scrollContainerRef.current && !hasReachedEnd) {
    // ... scroll detection logic
    setVisibleSlots(prev => {
      const newSlots = prev + 28;
      if (newSlots >= maxSlots) {
        setHasReachedEnd(true);
        return maxSlots;
      }
      return newSlots;
    });
  }
}, [hasReachedEnd, maxSlots]);
```

### End-of-Day Message
```typescript
{hasReachedEnd && (
  <div style={endOfDayMessageStyles}>
    End of day reached. No more appointments after 11:00 PM.
  </div>
)}
```

## User Experience
1. **Initial Load**: Calendar starts with 56 slots (8 AM to 10 PM)
2. **Infinite Scroll**: As user scrolls down, more time slots load automatically
3. **Limit Detection**: When 11:00 PM is reached, no more slots are loaded
4. **User Feedback**: Clear message informs user that no more appointments are available
5. **Smooth Experience**: No jarring stops or errors, just graceful end with informative message

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Development server runs successfully
- Infinite scroll functionality works as expected
- End-of-day message appears at the correct time
- No performance issues with the implementation

## Future Enhancements
- Could add configuration for different end times
- Could implement different messages for different scenarios
- Could add animations for the end-of-day message appearance
